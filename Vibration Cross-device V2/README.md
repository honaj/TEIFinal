# Vibrations

The code unfortunately only works on android and best on chrome!!!

This code shows how to control different vibration pattern from the computer to the phone when you press a certain button.

Link to vibration api: (https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/vibration/). Download the folder and install the npm to it. 

How the setup for these two variation of codes that uses npm will be shown in the folders.

# Setup 

In the directory you've got this sample:

`$ npm install` or `$ npm install --save reconnecting-websocket`

This will install the necessary packages from npm.

# Running

Once set up, you can boot up your server with

`$ npm start`

# After it start running

Take the portnumber and add it to the IPadress of your computer usally the IPv4 and open it on the phone with that webadress

Before you make the phone react to the button clicking on the computer you need to just touch the phone once so it gets conected/awake.
